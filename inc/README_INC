Modules in inc (basic headers/definitions):

# my1defs.h
  = basic/core definitions
  = allows code to be compiled by both sdcc and Keil compilers
    > custom macros to define sfr and sbit
  = also contains port/pin addresses for original mcu51
# my1macros.h
  = useful macros
# my1types.h
  = typedefs for 8-/16-/32-bit unsigned integers
# my1mcu51.h
  = most common header for original mcu51
    > equivalent to Keil's reg51.h
  = includes my1defs.h , my1macros.h and my1types.h
# mcu51.h
  = a more generic name
  = includes my1mcu51.h
# my1stc51.h
  = the header for stc51 microcontrollers
    > contains stc-specific port/pin/sfr addresses
  = includes my1mcu51.h
# stc51.h
